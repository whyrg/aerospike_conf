# [STATIC]:
#       This parameter must be set prior to service start and cannot be
#       changed once the service is running. Changing this value
#       requires a server (rolling) restart.
# [UNANIMOUS]:
#       This parameter must be identical across the entire cluster
# [FEATURE]:
#       This parameter requires a feature key to be usable. See the
#       'feature-key-file' parameter under the Service stanza.
